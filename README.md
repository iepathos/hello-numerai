# hello-numerai

Is an organized repository for the numer.ai Hellow tutorial.  This is an alternative to the notebook numer.ai provides which isn't 100% working.  This repo uses Poetry for dependency management, works on Ubuntu and Macos, and will train and output the first predict.pkl to upload to Numer.ai for your first submission.


Usage:

```
./install.sh
./run.sh
```

Then upload the output predict.pkl to Numer.ai
